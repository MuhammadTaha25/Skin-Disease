# 🍃 Potato Disease Classification  
## Computer Vision Project  

### 📌 Project Title  
**Potato Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning (CNN)**  

---

### 📖 Overview  
This project focuses on building an **AI-powered image classification model** to detect and categorize **potato leaf diseases**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model learns to differentiate between **healthy and diseased potato leaves**, enabling early diagnosis and preventive measures for crop protection.

### 🔑 Key Steps  
#### 1. Data Preparation  
- Collected and organized the **PlantVillage potato leaf dataset**  
- Partitioned dataset into **training, validation, and testing sets**  
- Applied preprocessing (**resizing, normalization, augmentation**)  

#### 2. Model Development  
- Designed a **CNN architecture** with multiple convolution and pooling layers  
- Used **data augmentation** to improve generalization  
- Implemented **Adam optimizer** and **SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss**  

#### 3. Training & Evaluation  
- Trained the model over multiple epochs with batch optimization  
- Evaluated performance on unseen test data  
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing **healthy vs. diseased leaves**  

#### 4. Results & Insights  
- Visualization of **training/validation accuracy and loss curves**  
- Test accuracy metrics showing strong model performance  
- Saved trained model for deployment or integration into real-world systems
